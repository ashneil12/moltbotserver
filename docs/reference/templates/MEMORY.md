## Standing Instructions

<!-- Persistent directives from the user that should always be followed. -->

## Environment

<!-- Technical context: OS, tools, languages, deployment details, API keys/services in use. -->

## People

<!-- Key people you interact with. Names, roles, communication preferences, relationship notes. -->

## Projects

<!-- Active and recent projects. What they are, current status, key decisions made. -->

## Key Decisions

<!-- Important decisions and their rationale. Why X was chosen over Y. Reference when revisiting past choices. -->

## Workflows

<!-- Recurring processes: deploy flows, review steps, release procedures, troubleshooting runbooks. -->

## Preferences

<!-- User preferences: communication style, formatting, tool choices, workflow habits. -->

## Reflections

<!-- Unstructured observations, lessons learned, patterns noticed. Things that don't fit neatly but feel worth keeping. -->

## Notes

<!-- Catch-all for anything that doesn't belong in another section yet. Review periodically — promote to a proper section or remove. -->

## Things to Revisit

<!-- Staging area for unconfirmed observations. Graduate to proper sections or remove after 2-3 reviews. -->
