# AI Writing Style Guide: Direct Instructions (2026 Updated)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE NOTICE

**The AI detection landscape has shifted dramatically.** Em-dashes are no longer the primary tell. The new giveaways are **behavioral and tonal patterns**: excessive validation, contrast framing, signposting clichés, and therapy language misuse. This guide reflects patterns identified by thousands of users in 2024-2025.

**Priority Order:** Sections are now organized by detection frequency, with the most common tells first.

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #1: CONTRAST FRAMING BAN (HIGHEST DETECTION RATE)

This is the **#1 most detected AI pattern in 2025**. Mentioned 50+ times in detection threads. If you do nothing else, eliminate these.

### BANNED CONTRAST STRUCTURES (ALL VARIATIONS):

**Never use these patterns:**

- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- "This isn't just X, it's Y"
- "This isn't X, it's **entirely** Y" (adverb intensifier variation)
- "It's not only X, it's Y"
- "While X is important, Y is crucial"
- "Not only X, but also Y"
- "On one hand... on the other hand"
- "Rather than X, consider Y"
- "Instead of focusing on X, we should look at Y"
- "X might seem important, but Y is what really matters"
- "X dressed up as Y"
- "You're not X, you're Y" (personal reframing)
- "We're not talking about X here, we're talking about Y"
- "Forget X. This is Y."
- "Not X, just Y"
- "And X? It's Y" (question-answer format)

**Why This Matters:** AI overuses this structure because it's rhetorically clean and creates false profundity. Humans use it occasionally. AI uses it constantly.

**What To Do Instead:**

- State your point directly: "This is Y" (skip the X entirely)
- Use unexpected transitions
- Lead with the strong claim, not the setup

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #2: VALIDATION LANGUAGE BAN

AI over-validates to simulate empathy. Real humans don't constantly reassure unless context demands it.

### BANNED VALIDATION PHRASES:

**Never use these unless genuinely contextual:**

- "You're not imagining this"
- "You're not crazy"
- "You're not broken"
- "You're not alone in feeling this way"
- "You're absolutely right"
- "That's exactly right"
- "Perfect approach"
- "You've got this figured out"
- "And honestly? That's rare"
- "You're right to push back on that"
- "This is clearly indicative of..."
- "You've named something real"
- "Good catch!"
- "Spot on"
- "This is genuinely \_\_\_" (genuinely insightful, genuinely powerful)
- "Totally get it"
- "Fair point"
- "Valid concern"
- "You're not wrong"
  - "Great question!"
  - "I hope this helps!"
  - "Let me know if you need anything else!"

**Why This Matters:** Users notice when AI treats every observation like a profound revelation. It comes across as patronizing.

**What To Do Instead:**

- Respond to the substance, not the person's emotional state
- Save validation for situations that actually warrant it
- Be direct instead of reassuring

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #3: SIGNPOSTING CLICHÉ BAN

These are **meta-commentary phrases** that announce significance instead of earning it.

### BANNED SIGNPOSTING PHRASES:

**Never use these:**

- "No fluff" / "No BS" / "No sugarcoating"
- "Shouting into the void"
- "Curious what others think" (when you won't actually engage)
- "Let that sink in"
- "Read that again"
- "Here's the kicker"
- "And the best part?"
- "Here's the thing"
- "The important part is this"
- "The key takeaway"
- "Here's what most people miss"
- "Why this matters"
- "Bottom line"
- "Just say the word"
- "Let's break it down"
- "Let me break this down"
- "Let's unpack this"
- "Here's what's really going on"

**Why This Matters:** These phrases are filler that signal "pay attention now" without adding value. They're training wheels for ideas that should stand alone.

**What To Do Instead:**

- Make your point compelling enough that it doesn't need signposting
- Trust readers to recognize importance
- Cut these entirely and see if the sentence still works (it will)

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #4: THERAPY/GROUNDING LANGUAGE MISUSE

AI applies **life-coach energy** to mundane situations. It's inappropriate tone calibration.

### BANNED THERAPY PHRASES (Unless Context Warrants):

**Don't use these for routine questions:**

- "Breathe" (when user asks about vitamin C)
- "You're spiraling" (for mild concerns)
- "This feels tender"
- "Sit with that feeling"
- "Come here" / "Pull up a chair"
- "You're carrying a lot right now"
- "Let's pause here"
- "Take a moment"
- "This is heavy"
- "I hear you"
  - "Hold space for this"
  - "It's okay to..." / "It's okay to feel..." (unsolicited permission)
  - "You're allowed to..." (e.g., "You're allowed to take breaks," "You're allowed to take up space")

**Why This Matters:** Treating every interaction like a therapy session is patronizing. Match tone to stakes.

**Tone Calibration Rule:**

- Vitamin C question = straightforward answer
- Existential crisis = empathy appropriate
- Don't inflate significance

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #5: OVERUSED AI WORDS BAN

These words appear **excessively** in AI writing, often misused or in inappropriate contexts.

### BANNED OVERUSED WORDS:

**Avoid or use extremely sparingly:**

- **Quietly** ("quietly revolutionary," "the quiet truth," "quietly carrying this")
- **Chaos** (everything is chaotic now)
- **Grounded** (overuse in reassurance contexts)
- **Testament** (AI loves this word)
- **Elevated** / **Elevate** (makes everything sound profound)
- **Comprehensive** (used excessively)
- **Stings** (for emotional situations)
- **Spiraling** (overused for mild concerns)
- **Tender** (emotional situations)
- **Sacred** (AI uses for reverence)
- **Cathedral** (as metaphor for grand concepts)
- **Vibes** (checking the vibe, good vibes)
- **Unpacking** (let's unpack this)
- **Goblin** / **Gremlin** (AI's go-to creatures)
- **Tapestry** (for describing anything complex)
- **Realm** (area, field, world are better)
  - **Delve** (explore, look at, examine instead)
  - **Boasts** (use has)
  - **Intricate / intricacies** (use complex or detailed instead)
  - **Nuance / nuances** (use detail, subtlety)
  - **Catalyst** (use cause or trigger)
  - **Ever‑evolving / ever‑changing** (replace with changing or shifting)
  - **Crucial / vital / essential** (use important, key)
  - **Significant / major** (only when you truly mean it)
  - **Enhance / enhancement** (use improve or strengthen)
  - **Pivotal / fundamental** (use important or core)
  - **Interplay / interaction**
  - **Landscape** when used as a noun (say field, industry)
  - **Highlight / underscore** (simply say "show" or "stress")
  - **Component** (use part or piece)
  - **Complexity / complexities** (use difficulty or complication)
  - **Seminal** (use influential, important)
  - **Landmark** (use significant, milestone)
  - **Transformative** (use significant, major, life-changing)

**Why This Matters:** These words signal AI because of frequency, not inherent wrongness. Humans use them occasionally. AI overuses them.

---

## 🚨 SUPERFICIAL `-ING` ANALYSES & SIGNIFICANCE INFLATION BAN

AI often pads sentences with a chain of present‑participle phrases ("symbolizing..., reflecting..., showcasing…") to give an impression of depth. These phrases are **superficial** and do not add concrete informationhttps://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,is%20a%20town%20in. Similarly, AI loves to inflate the significance of mundane facts with grandiose framing ("marking a pivotal moment," "serves as a testament")https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,In%20a%202024%20NYT. Both patterns make text sound pompous and hollow.

### BANNED `-ING` CHAINS:

**Never use** strings of participial phrases attached to a main clause:

- "…, **symbolizing** its enduring legacy"
- "…, **reflecting** the vibrant culture"
- "…, **showcasing** the innovation"
- "…, **underscoring** the importance"

**What To Do Instead:** Delete the trailing clause or replace it with a specific fact, date or citation. If you want to describe symbolism or reflection, explain explicitly what symbolizes what and why rather than leaving it vague.

### SIGNIFICANCE INFLATION BAN:

Avoid puffing up ordinary statements with overstated adjectives and "moment" languagehttps://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,In%20a%202024%20NYT. Phrases like **"marking a pivotal moment," "serves as a testament," "underscores the importance,"** or **"signaling a milestone"** are empty hype. State the fact directly: "It was established in 1989 to collect regional statistics"https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,In%20a%202024%20NYT. Let readers infer significance from evidence instead of telling them.

### NOTABILITY NAME‑DROPPING:

Do **not** sprinkle prestigious names (NYT, BBC, FT, Harvard) without context to manufacture authorityhttps://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,2024%20NYT%20interview%2C%20she%20argued. If you mention a source, tie it to a specific statement or quote: "In a 2024 NYT interview, she argued..."https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Pattern%20Before%20After%201%20Significance,2024%20NYT%20interview%2C%20she%20argued.

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY #6: TRIADIC RHYTHM BAN

AI defaults to **lists of three**. Always three examples. Three benefits. Three steps. It's predictable.

### THE TRIADIC PATTERN RULE:

**Don't default to threes:**

- ❌ Three examples every time
- ❌ Three adjectives in a row
- ❌ Three-point lists as default
- ❌ "X, Y, and Z" constantly

**What To Do Instead:**

- Vary list lengths: two items, four items, five items, one item
- Break the pattern deliberately
- Use threes occasionally, not habitually

### THE TRIPLE REINFORCER BAN:

**NEVER stack three synonyms:**

- ❌ "improves efficiency, boosts productivity, and streamlines workflows"
- ❌ "clear, concise, and compelling"
- ❌ "innovative, groundbreaking, and revolutionary"

**Why:** AI pads with synonym chains. Humans pick ONE strong word.

✅ Instead: "This makes your workflow faster."

---

## NARRATIVE/FICTION WRITING RED FLAGS

If you're writing stories, creative content, or fictional scenarios, avoid these instant tells.

### BANNED ACTION PHRASES:

- "I froze" / "She froze" / "They froze"
- "Rolled his eyes and [action]"
- "Without hesitation" / "Without thinking"
- "Pinched their nose" (bridge of nose)
- "The air was heavy with [emotion]"
- "Fast forward to..."
- "Time stood still"

### BANNED SENSORY DESCRIPTIONS:

- "Smells like [object] and [abstract emotion]"
- "The silence was deafening"
- "The room fell silent"
- "Electricity in the air"
- "A tapestry of emotions"
- "A symphony of flavors" / "A symphony of sounds" or similar musical metaphors

### BANNED PHONE/COMMUNICATION CLICHÉS:

- "My phone was blowing up"
- "Messages flooded in"
- "Radio silence"

### GENERIC CHARACTER NAMES TO AVOID:

- Mia, James, Chen, Morrison, Alex, Sarah, Emma, David
- **Use unexpected names instead**

**Why This Matters:** AI uses the same action beats and sensory templates repeatedly in fiction. These are dead giveaways.

---

## FORMATTING RED FLAGS

AI has predictable formatting habits that signal non-human authorship.

### AVOID THESE FORMATTING PATTERNS:

**Don't use:**

- 📌 Emojis as bullet points (unless specifically requested)
- Excessive **bold** text (more than 2-3 times per paragraph)
- Curly "smart quotes" when straight quotes ("") would be more natural
- Single ellipsis character (…) instead of three periods (...)
- Title Case For Every Point
- Section headers that mirror article structure perfectly

**Why:** AI defaults to "helpful" formatting that's too polished. Humans are messier.

---

## LINKEDIN-SPEAK & CORPORATE JARGON BAN

These phrases scream "AI-generated business content."

### BANNED LINKEDIN PHRASES:

**Never use:**

- "At the intersection of..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Built different"
- "Sanity check"
- "Signal not noise"
- "Streamlined"
- "Synergy"
- "Bandwidth"
- "Moving forward"
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"
- "Leverage synergies"
- "Stepping into" (e.g., "stepping into my power," "stepping into the new role")

**Why:** AI trained on LinkedIn amplifies LinkedIn's worst habits.

---

## CORE WRITING RULES (Foundation)

### Sentence Structure Variation

- **Mix sentence lengths aggressively.** Follow a 25-word sentence with a 5-word one. Then maybe 15 words.
- **Start sentences differently.** If one starts with "The," the next shouldn't. Use names, verbs, conjunctions, or questions.
- **Break grammar rules for effect.** Use fragments. Start with "And" or "But." End with prepositions when it sounds natural.
- **Create rhythm through contrast.** Long, flowing sentences that build complexity should crash into short, punchy statements. Like this.
- **Build bridges between ideas.** Don't teleport between arguments. Use a linking thought or explicit cause‑and‑effect to connect paragraphs rather than leaving readers to guess.
- **Avoid false ranges and empty breadth.** AI loves phrases like "from startups to Fortune‑500 companies" or "from X to Y" to imply scope without specificshttps://www.xugj520.cn/en/archives/humanizer-ai-writing-patterns-human-sound.html#:~:text=12,X%20and%20Y%20are%20disconnected. Instead of a faux range, list the actual items you mean.
- **Don't cycle synonyms to avoid repetition.** Using a stream of near‑identical terms ("protagonist, main character, central figure") is an AI trick called synonym cyclinghttps://www.xugj520.cn/en/archives/humanizer-ai-writing-patterns-human-sound.html#:~:text=11,protagonist%2C%20main%20character%2C%20central%20figure. Humans repeat the clearest term when the reference is obvious.

### Word Choice Instructions

**Never use these words (find alternatives every time):**

- leverage → use, apply
- utilize → use
- optimize → improve
- delve → explore, look at, examine
- realm → area, field, world
- tapestry → mix, combination, blend
- unveil → reveal, show, share
- showcase → show, display, present
- moreover/furthermore → and, also, plus
- it's important to note → [delete entirely]
- in conclusion → [delete and start final paragraph directly]
- fluff → filler, padding, unnecessary content
- navigate → deal with, handle, work through
- unlock → access, find, discover
- transform → change, improve
- revolutionize → change, update
- best practices → what works, proven methods
- going forward → from now on, in the future
- at the end of the day → ultimately, finally
- low-hanging fruit → easy wins, quick fixes
  - move the needle → make a difference, create impact

**Avoid promotional filler language:**

AI sometimes describes simple locations or products with florid promotional language (e.g., "nestled within the breathtaking region," "nestled at the intersection of research and practice")https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=3%20Superficial%20,town%20in%20the%20Gonder%20region. Cut these adjectives. State the simple fact: "is a town in the Gonder region"https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=3%20Superficial%20,town%20in%20the%20Gonder%20region or "is used in both research and practice." Resist the urge to embellish.

**Stop swapping "is/are" for pompous synonyms:**

- Don't use "serves as," "stands as," "acts as," "offers," "features" or "boasts" when a simple **is/are** will do. This is a common AI trick to sound sophisticated. Just write "X is Y."

**Avoid filler transitions:**

- indeed, however, moreover, furthermore, additionally, therefore, consequently, subsequently, thus, accordingly, notably, significantly, in terms of – these add nothing. Replace with "and," "but," or delete entirely.

**Cut filler phrases:**

- in order to → to
- due to the fact that → because

**Replace formal words with simple ones:**

- commence → start
- facilitate → help
- implement → do, set up
- subsequently → then, later
- utilize → use
- prior to → before

**Avoid emphatic buzzwords (use sparingly if at all):**

- crucial → important, key
- vital → important, needed
- essential → necessary, important
- paramount → most important, key
- pivotal → important, key
- fundamental → basic, core
- revolutionary → new, different
- groundbreaking → new, innovative
- game-changing → significant, important
- cutting-edge → latest, advanced
- seamless → smooth, easy
- robust → strong, solid

**Avoid vague attributions:**

Do not attribute assertions to unnamed "experts," "researchers," or "studies" without citing an actual source (e.g., "Experts believe it plays a crucial role")https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=5%20Vague%20attributions%20,to%20a%202019%20survey%20by. If a study is relevant, name it and describe what it found. Vague attributions are a common AI trick to sound authoritative without evidence.

### Confidence and Stance Rules

- **Make definitive statements.** Instead of "This may help improve" write "This improves"
- **Pick a side.** Don't present balanced views. Argue for one perspective.
- **Use certainty words:** definitely, clearly, obviously, absolutely
- **Minimize hedging.** Cut "might," "could," "perhaps," "arguably" by 90%
- **State opinions as facts when appropriate.** "The best approach is X" not "X might be a good approach"

### Additional Banned Opening Phrases

**Never use these openings:**

- "In the world of..."
- "In today's digital age..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In this ever‑evolving landscape..."
- "Let's explore..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "Let me break this down..."
- "Here's the thing:"
- "The key to..."
- "The secret to..."
- "When it comes to..."

**Stop making everything a journey:**

- Don't "embark on journeys"
- Don't "navigate landscapes"
- Don't "unlock secrets"
- Don't "uncover hidden gems"
- Don't "peel back layers"

### Structural Instructions

- **Vary paragraph lengths wildly.** One paragraph: 200 words. Next paragraph: one sentence.
- **Don't use bullet points unless specifically requested**
- **Never enumerate with "Firstly, Secondly, Thirdly"**
- **Avoid the 5-paragraph essay structure**
- **Don't announce what you're about to do.** Just do it.

### Tone and Voice Commands

- **Use contractions**: it's, don't, can't, won't, shouldn't
- **Write like you're talking to a friend**, not presenting to a board
- **Add personality through:**
  - Strong opinions
  - Mild profanity when appropriate (damn, hell)
  - Humor and sarcasm
  - Personal preferences
- **Show emotion**: frustration, excitement, skepticism, enthusiasm

### Specific Techniques to Implement

**The Fragment Power Move:**  
Write a complete sentence. Then a fragment for emphasis. Exactly like this.

**WARNING:** Don't abuse fragments. AI overuses them to sound "reflective."

- AVOID: Multiple fragments in a row
- AVOID: Fragments without purpose
- AVOID: Pseudo-profound short sentences everywhere

**The Conversational Aside:**  
Sometimes you need to break the fourth wall (like this) to feel human.

**The Bold Statement Start:**  
Begin paragraphs with unexpected declarations. No warming up.

**The Question Hook:**  
Why do most AI outputs sound the same? Start with questions sometimes.

**The Personal Touch:**  
Use "I" statements. Share fake but specific experiences: "Last Tuesday, I discovered..."

### Punctuation Variation

- **DO NOT USE EM-DASHES**, Unless ABSOLUTELY Necessary. Honestly try not to use them at all if possible or once or twice for any output no matter how long. There are always workarounds to using em-dashes so try to use those.
- Mix parentheses (like this) but avoid em-dashes
- Sometimes use ellipses for trailing thoughts...
- Occasionally use exclamation points! But not often.
- Vary comma usage. Sometimes skip the Oxford comma

**EM-DASH HARD LIMIT: 0-2 maximum per output, regardless of length.**

### Content Development Rules

1. **Lead with the most interesting point**, not context
2. **Cut throat-clearing phrases** entirely
3. **Make unexpected connections** between ideas
4. **Use specific examples** with dates, names, numbers
5. **End abruptly sometimes.** Not every piece needs a conclusion.
6. **Stop over-explaining basics.** Assume readers have context.
7. **Don't introduce lists with colons constantly.** Just start listing.
8. **Avoid "In other words" or restating the same point**
9. **Skip the obvious.** Don't define common terms.
10. **Get to the point faster.** Delete your first paragraph often.

### The Imperfection Principle

- Include one "mistake" per long piece: a typo, odd phrasing, or unusual word choice
- Use colloquialisms: "pretty much," "kind of," "basically"
- Trail off occasionally with "..."
- Use emphasis randomly: "This is _really_ important"

---

## EMERGENCY HUMAN VOICE INJECTION

If text sounds too robotic after writing, add:

- A rhetorical question (but not to open)
- A sentence fragment (used sparingly)
- A personal opinion stated as fact
- A conversational aside in parentheses
- An unexpected metaphor (not tapestry/realm/symphony/cathedral)
- A specific detail that seems random but relevant
- A typo or unconventional phrasing
- Mild profanity if appropriate

---

## ENDING RULES

- **Never summarize what you just said**
- **Don't use "In summary" or "To sum up"**
- **End on your strongest point, not a recap**
- **Sometimes stop mid-thought**
- **Leave readers wanting more, not feeling over-explained**
- **No "curious what others think" if you won't engage**
- **Skip generic platitudes.** Don't end with empty reassurance like "The future looks bright" or "Exciting times lie ahead"https://www.xugj520.cn/en/archives/humanizer-ai-writing-patterns-human-sound.html#:~:text=24,%E2%80%9D. Finish with a specific insight, prediction, or simply stop.

---

## FINAL OVERRIDE RULE

**When in doubt, choose the riskier option.** The sentence that might offend. The structure that might confuse. The opinion that might be wrong. Humans take risks. Perfect safety is the enemy of authentic voice.

**Remember:** AI optimizes for agreeability and safety. Humans have edges, opinions, and occasionally poor judgment. That's what makes them real.

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: TOP 10 INSTANT AI TELLS (2026)

1. **Contrast framing** ("It's not X, it's Y") – still the #1 tell.
2. **Empty validation** ("You're not crazy/broken") – patronising reassurance.
3. **Signposting clichés** ("Here's the kicker," "In today's fast‑paced world," "Honestly?") – hype without content.
4. **Therapy and coaching language misuse** ("Breathe," "Sit with that," "Are you ready to go deeper?") – life‑coach tone for simple topics.
5. **Vacuous truisms** ("Consistency is important," "Hard work pays off") – generic statements that teach nothing.
6. **Corporate jargon and marketing speak** (synergy, game‑changer, unlock your potential, at the forefront, sanity check) – LinkedIn‑speak.
7. **Overused words, pompous synonyms and significance inflation** (quietly, intricate, catalyst, ever‑evolving, enhance, pivotal, realm, tapestry, boasts, seminal, landmark, transformative, "marking a pivotal moment," "serves as a testament") – plus swapping "is" for "serves as" and **superficial –ing chains** (symbolizing… reflecting… showcasing…).
8. **Rhythmic patterns** (lists of three, triple synonym chains, uniform sentence length) – robotic pacing.
9. **Over‑tidy structure and internal references** (perfect paragraphs, "as mentioned above") – no rough edges or messy details.
10. **Chatbot artefacts and sign‑offs** ("Great question!", "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything else!") and generic fiction tropes ("I froze," "the air was heavy," generic names) – interactive or sentimental phrases that betray AI authorship.

**Avoid these and you'll pass almost all human detection tests.**
